Biography
======
Zhao Zhang joined the School of Astronomy and Space Science at Nanjing University in September 2019, where he is majoring in Astrophysics advised by *Assoc. Prof*. [Binbin Zhang](https://astronomylab.nju.edu.cn/English/Faculty/Associateprofessors/20210207/i187831.html), pursuing the research on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and related fields.

He received his B.S. degree in physics from Guangxi University in June 2019. and studied the progenitors of GRBs emitted from black holes under the guidance of *Prof*. [Houjun LÃ¼](https://astro.gxu.edu.cn/info/1047/1081.htm) during the undergraduate period.

Parallelly, he often has fruitful discussions with *Mr*. [Tianyue Li](https://tobeyleonard.github.io/) on the fundamentals of optics, expecting to outspread the range of Astrophotonics.

<!-- __Update: I will be joining Stanford University as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2021!__ -->

<div style="font-size:12pt"><strong>Fast Support Reduction</strong></div>
</div>
<div style="font-size:10pt"> In layer-based 3D fabrication, supporting structures are fabricated
to support overhanging regions yet discarded later. Reducing supports
saves both time and material cost. In this project, we propose 
a real-time skinning-based method to slim down the
supporting structure while maintaining a detailed-preserved and semantically meaningful geometry.
We achieve this by optimizing a set of performance objectives and searching globally in
the subspace spanned by the joint handles. Artifacts e.g. self-intersection can be effectively avoided.
Our method is implemented via OpenGL shaders and has potential to be
employed as a structural prototyping tool that facilitates model design and fabrication. </div>
